> Estimated Martian paleopole locations shown on an elevation base map with the  
> location of Jezero Crater and the Tharsis volcanic province labeled. The ancient position of the  
> Martian spin axis (i.e. the paleopole) has been interpreted from both geophysical and geologic data.  
> The pole positions shown here come from: inversions to magnetic anomalies (38), the interpreted  
> position of the pre-Tharsis rotational bulge (39), and polar deposits offset from the pole (40). The  
> paleopoles estimated from inverted magnetic anomalies are both in the southern and northern  
> hemisphere consistent with a reversing dynamo field. For ease of comparison, the antipodes of  
> reversed estimates are plotted so that all poles are in a unified northern hemisphere polarity with  
> differing symbology for normal and reversed paleopoles. Both the noise in the data and non-  
> uniqueness in the inversions complicate the estimates of ancient pole position from the magnetic  
> anomaly data. The differing estimates of ancient pole positions from these data make distinct  
> predictions for the magnitude of Martian true polar wander that have the potential to be tested  
> through the paleomagnetic directions of returned Jezero crater rocks.
